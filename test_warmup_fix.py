    print(f"   - Increased alert cooldown (5min → 10min)")
    print(f"   - 3-minute minimum runtime before signals")
    print(f"   - Smaller candlestick spreads (3% → 1%)")
    
    print(f"\n🎯 Expected Behavior:")
    print(f"   - No signals in first 2 minutes")
    print(f"   - Reduced false signals from demo data")
    print(f"   - Only quality signals after warm-up")
    print(f"   - Better user experience")
