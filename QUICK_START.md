**Ready to test a professional two-stage trading system? Here's how:**

## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Download & Extract
- Download the zip file
- Extract to a folder (like `trading-system-test`)
- Open terminal/command prompt in that folder

### 2. Install Python Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

*If you get permission errors on Mac/Linux:*
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Test the System
**Option A: Complete Two-Stage Workflow**
```bash
python trading_workflow.py
```

**Option B: Quick BTC Demo**
```bash
python btc_professional_demo.py
```

*On Mac/Linux, use `python3` instead of `python`*

## 🎯 What You'll See

### Option A: Complete Two-Stage System
1. **Stage 1 Scanner** - Finds opportunities across 15+ coins using:
   - FVG (Fair Value Gap) detection
   - Trendline breakout analysis
   - Volume spike detection
   - Pattern recognition
2. **Human Selection** - You pick which opportunities to trade
3. **Stage 2 Execution** - Professional risk management applied to your selections

### Option B: Quick BTC Demo
1. **Enter your account size** (try $50,000 for realistic demo)
2. **Watch live data** flow from Binance across 5 timeframes
3. **See confluence analysis** - either a trading signal or explanation why not

- ✅ **Multi-timeframe confluence** (5 timeframes must agree)
- ✅ **Professional risk management** (1% position sizing)

## 🔍 Try These Tests

1. **Run it multiple times** - see how market conditions change
2. **Try different account sizes** - $10K, $100K, $1M
3. **Check the mathematics** - verify the position sizing calculations
4. **Test during different market hours** - see how volume affects signals

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **This is for testing only** - not financial advice
- **System requires VPN** if you're in the US (Binance restriction)
- **No API keys needed** - uses public market data
- **Conservative by design** - may show "no signal" frequently (that's good!)

## 💬 Report Back

After testing, share:
- ✅ Did it work on your machine?
- ✅ What signal (if any) did you get?
- ✅ What account size did you test?
- ✅ Any errors or issues?
- ✅ How fast was the data response?

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Can't install requirements"** → Try: `pip3 install ccxt pandas numpy pytz`

**"Binance API error"** → You might need a VPN to non-US location

**"No module named..."** → Make sure you're in the right folder and ran pip install

**"Permission denied"** → Try: `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`

**This is live market analysis happening in real-time. Either it generates a trading signal or it explains why there isn't one. Both outcomes demonstrate the system is working correctly.**
