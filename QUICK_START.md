## 🔍 Enhanced Testing Guide

python opportunity_scanner.py
# Try each option:
# 1 = Static traditional analysis
# 2 = Top gainers (momentum plays) 
# 3 = Top losers (reversal setups)
# 4 = Mixed analysis (balanced approach)
# 5 = Custom scan (your parameters)
```

### 2. Compare Market Conditions
- **During bull market**: Try gainers scan for momentum
- **During bear market**: Try losers scan for reversals
- **Sideways market**: Try mixed scan for opportunities

### 3. Analyze Results Quality
- **Volume filtering**: Notice all results have $1M+ volume
- **Multi-timeframe**: Check how confluence affects scores
- **Pattern recognition**: Look for Head & Shoulders, breakouts
- **FVG analysis**: Observe volume-confirmed gaps

### 4. Test Market Responsiveness
1. **Run gainers scan** → Note top performers
2. **Wait 30 minutes** → Run again
3. **Compare results** → See real-time market adaptation

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **This is for testing only** - not financial advice
- **System requires VPN** if you're in the US (Binance restriction)
- **No API keys needed** - uses public market data
- **Conservative by design** - may show "no signal" frequently (that's good!)
- **Dynamic discovery** - results change based on real market conditions

## 💬 Enhanced Report Back

After testing the new features, share:
- ✅ Which scan mode worked best for current market conditions?
- ✅ Did you see different results between gainers/losers scans?
- ✅ How many coins showed STRONG vs MODERATE vs WEAK signals?
- ✅ Did the multi-timeframe confluence make sense?
- ✅ What was the highest scoring opportunity and why?
- ✅ Any errors or issues with the enhanced features?

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Can't install requirements"** → Try: `pip3 install ccxt pandas numpy pytz scipy matplotlib`

**"Binance API error"** → You might need a VPN to non-US location

**"No module named..."** → Make sure you're in the right folder and ran pip install

**"Permission denied"** → Try: `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`

**"Low scores on all scans"** → This is normal! The system filters for high-quality setups only

**This enhanced system now discovers opportunities dynamically across the entire cryptocurrency market. It can adapt to bull markets (gainers), bear markets (losers), or mixed conditions. Each scan mode uses institutional-grade analysis with multi-timeframe confluence validation.**
